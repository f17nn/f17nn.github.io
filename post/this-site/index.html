                    <div class="em"><p>A few years ago I had an idea for a short movie about a guy staying at a house in the middle of nowhere to finish a book he was writing. For the longest time I had no idea where I was going with that. I had a few thoughts and a general idea about the ending. After a while I realized that I would rather make the movie into a game or rather an interactive story. I wrote a few lines in text file and it stayed like that in a folder until a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been doing a lot of soul searching and this project jumped back on me while I was flying to Berlin. During the flight I managed to write the outline of the whole story and over my week there I wrote most of the design document needed for me to start working on it.</p>

<p>“The House”, as I still call it, is a very personal project. I used to think of these things I draw and code as stuff I do for fun but this is something different. It’s a story about being lost, about life and the regrets one has when looking back. Ultimately it’s a story about making sense of the things that surround you and trying to find your way out of the woods.</p>

<p>I could go on to list the things that have influenced me and saying stuff like “this is going to be a cross between this and that with a bit of that other thing”, but I’m not going to do that. I know what it’s going to look like and, more importantly, feel like to me. I don’t know how anyone else is going to feel about it and it doesn’t matter. It’s just a story I had to tell.</p>

<p>More info to follow soon.</p>

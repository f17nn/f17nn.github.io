      <description>A few years ago I had an idea for a short movie about a guy staying at a house in the middle of nowhere to finish a book he was writing. For the longest time I had no idea where I was going with that. I had a few thoughts and a general idea about the ending. After a while I realized that I would rather make the movie into a game or rather an interactive story.</description>
